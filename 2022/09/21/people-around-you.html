    It is easy to be caught up by work, life and everything in between. This seems to be 
    all too relatable. The fact that I am in a college town and am a college student just
    enables me to simply turn a blind eye to the community around me. There is no point, as 
    the lack of wisdom goes, of the people around you but your peers. Plus, it helps that 
    they are young and pretty and humans just have the penchant of seeking out beauty.
</p>

<p>
    Though it might sound innocuous, from an economic point of view, my indifference
    was extremely costly. The opportunities that I could have explored, the people that I would 
    otherwise know if I hadn't lived in a world filled only by the immediate gratifications
    of college life. I have never quite understood Brent's ruminations about community; I swear
    it is a preoccupation that I have never shared with him but it was in this obscure
    coffee shop where I saw the pieces falling together. People that are secretly running this
    city, without the diabolical predisposition that we often associate them with.
</p>

<p>
    Maybe I should pay attention to my community, whatever that is. Perhaps a moment knowing
    that I have been the puller of strings, one that does not control but brings us together.
    It was interesting, and I hope I remember this. With time weathering memory, I just
    wanted to note that whatever reason the reader might be here for, I hope he remembers that 
    there is more than just this, there are people around you.
