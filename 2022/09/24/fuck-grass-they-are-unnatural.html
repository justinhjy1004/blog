   "You know, they shoot you in Texas if you walk on the grass." Jesse murmured, intimating
   that we should walk on the paved road as we were heading towards the Union. "Really? Well,
   not surprising, it is Texas after all." I replied, not bothered given the fact that I am
   safely in the warm heartland of the Midwest. "I was just kidding, but you'd get stares
   if you do that" Jesse said. 
</p>

<p>
    I never quite understood why she not so subtly suggested us to walk on the paved road. 
    It probably was just her white platform shoes that she wears all the time, compensating
    her lack of height. A little part of me does wish that platform shoes are more of a thing
    for men in general. But there is a sense of defiance while walking, a small win for my
    rebellious heart to fight against the tyrannical forces that shape this world! Though in
    all honesty, I would take the paved road if was the shorter of the two. It was a 
    testament of indolence, not insubordination.
</p>

<p>
    There's plenty to be liked on the paved road. One can simply saunder to the path that it
    leads, hoping that everything is the same. Never caring that if there would be mud to avoid,
    or roots to be tripped. Most of it, if well constructed and maintained, provides a rhythm of 
    steps that mimics the pace of life a normal person would desire. The grass at the side are 
    simply hints of the reality that we live in, a simulacra one might call, where the land
    lays fallow and the grass well trimmed. There is a sense of peace, while constant 
    fabrication was done to perpetuate this tranquility.

    What is the fuss then with all this hate on grass? Brent would argue that this is 
    an unnatural way of how people walk and the right to walk has been infringed too often
    without challenge. I'd agree with that. But it has been an endeavor in humanity's
    entirety to shape and polish out the impurities that life promises, eroding the 
    dirt to keep our white platformed shoes white. The ugly truth, exemplified by the 
    untame wilderness, has been extensively patched up by our eagerness to deny its existence. 
</p>

<p>
    The allure is comprehensible, and one should be justifiably contempt of those who
    deny it. I am no exception, constantly finding myself tapering over the cracks in life
    that bothers me. Though I find myself tearing down this tapestry to peek into what it
    has to offer. Counterintuitively, I find life unbearable with constancy, when I know that 
    my road is paved; but simultaneously fear what I do not know. And so now I am stepping
    on this well-mowed, well-maintained pasture, derived from the suburban hellscape that I 
    had once called home. And that is perhaps the road I will take, the determined
    stochastic life I will call my future, shrouded with known mysteries that I would one
    day discover.
