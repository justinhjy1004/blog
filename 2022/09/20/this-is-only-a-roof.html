    It was paradise. Everything was great; no rules, no requirements, nothing. Well, almost
    nothing. Jack's mum usually would be around, meandering around her house. I always wondered
    what she did but Jack would only scoff and said she was good for nothing. I would see 
    her on her desk, and in the most sincerest form, acting busy whilst doing nothing. But I
    was young and carefree, and all I thought was "this is definitely better than my place".
</p>

<p>
    Jack's home, to me, was paradise, if paradise existed. He would corroborate that we were 
    heading to his place to study and ended up doing nothing of such. If I could name
    a best friend in my teenage year, it would be him. Plus, we were doing fairly well in 
    school and our parents stopped questioning what we did or did not do, not that Jack's mum
    cared nor his dad, who I've only seen once, ransacking the kitchen hurriedly and left
    soon after. At least he left some food that he cooked, and Jack said we could eat it and so we did.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, the background image was a little misleading, well actually, very much so. A
    typical flat that you would find in Penang would look more like the ones below; one that 
    reflects a lot of the spirit of the people. Some would call it decrepit and poor but I beg to defer.
    To me, this was liberty. Something that I could never obtain in my suburban home with 
    at least 5 times the size a tiny flat where Jack used to live. But the space that it 
    gave me did not translate to freedom, because in my home, there were rules.
</p>

<p>
    "This is only a roof." blurted Jack as we were in a random conversation that I could not 
    remember. "What do you mean?" I replied, confused. "I have lived here on this island for
    about 15 years but I never have a place that I could call home." "This is rented, it is not
    mine. Who knows when I have to move again?" with his voice increasingly emotional. I stayed quiet.
    I knew that this was not a conversation that I wanted to be involved in, nor did I understand what he 
    was saying. I always thought that I would trade places with him in a heartbeat if I had
    the chance to, and his complaints were merely a relic of his misunderstandings with
    his parents.
</p>

<p>
    Now that I am in search for a home, I have begun to wrap my head
    around what he felt. I don't think 
    that there is truly a way to understand since it has always been my choice to move. 
    I have a house in 
    Malaysia where my parents would welcome me back without a doubt. After all, an empty
    birdnest can be at times hollowing. 
</p>

<p>
    And in all honesty, this realization has slowly crept into me. It was cruel that a 15 year
    old should feel that way as I realize that to this day, I lack the maturity to comprehend
    nor grasp the idea of being homeless with a home. The feeling that my country has rejected me,
    that my country denies my existence hovers between the conscious and the unconscious; sometimes banishing me
    to a solemn torment, one that is only in my head, so they say. 
</p>

<p>
    Maybe our definitiion of belonging, of a home, is wrong. Maybe it should evolve over time.
    But the undeniable fact is that feeling belonged is perhaps an innate feature that we have 
    unlearned from the past in this modern world.
