   The whirlwind that is life has never ending twists and turns. As I was preparing and checklisting
   all that I can plan, I left GRE to the stars and they were not in my favor. ETS
   would be damned for not allowing me to take the exam though in all honesty the only
   culpable was me. How could I have not checked the simple requirements, when Jack 
   was even surprised I never thought about that. 
</p>

<p>
    The anger, the ire and the shame dissipated quite quickly as I turned 23, realizing
    that this number seem to feel of less importance, where it no longer marks an important
    transition in life. How quickly it meant nothing after obtaining the highly coveted 
    horizontal driver's licence when you turn 21, and it seems that that was the only thing
    that mattered for a while. Until it was not. And with that, I found out how useless it 
    could be, as it was not 'sufficient' to be get me into my GRE test.
</p>

<p>
    Oh how much life has changed since I felt a sense of 'consciousness'! I do not know
    when did that happen, nor do I quite recall what happened in those years. Nor do
    I think that I could recall the time that I had grown some 'sensibility', as they 
    were peppered with angst and guilt; two elements that are essential for troubled
    childhood. But how much fortunes have changed, when it almost seemed like throwing $200
    out of the window left me barely fazed. 
</p>

   Is it too much to ask for a time machine? I profess I am not the most selfless person;
   I would never risk going to Germany to try to kill Hitler. Somehow people just assume 
   that it would be a walk in the park, not considering the nearly impossible task to 
   get a gun and perhaps even to get into Austria just to murder a baby in his crib. No, I 
   wouldn't do any of those, but I need to let my younger self know that the world 
   conspires for you. Your parents would not disown you. In fact, they love you more than 
   ever! Life is not a dead-end road, and that perhaps your goals today are merely a figment
   of a poorly thought out desire, that you soon realize could never bring you true 
   happiness. You are, at 23, alone and by all metrics a failure. But he is happier than he
   ever felt in his life!
</p>

<p>
    Fortunes change, and maybe reflecting on this a year later would not make any sense. In 
    retrospect, I am very fortuitous. For some reason, the worst outcomes turn their heads 
    around and present me a blessing that I never would realize until much later. I am grateful,
    I am happy, and I am contented. That is enough.
