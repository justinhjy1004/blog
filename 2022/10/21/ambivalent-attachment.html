   Enveloped, the surreal feeling of being a small part of a whole, covered in warmth
   that promises security. Without an explicit proclamation, there is always the subtle
   agreement that this was all between us. The beauty of it all was discovered in cruising
   through barren-roads; calming silence, random commotions, and pretending that there was
   something to say. Furtive glances (it was my modus operandi), as your profile has 
   that enigmatic tranquility as you maintain your focus at the road ahead. It was a haze.
</p>

<p>
    The intermissions between weekends, when it would take 20 minutes for a saving grace
    to arrive, which peppered my summer with hope amidst the gruelling work. Waiting at an 
    airport bar, then we took off, even only for a few hours, these momentary feelings
    made all of summer worth it. I should have told you that. I don't think you know how 
    much that meant to me.
</p>

<p>
    And my lurching concerns crept up, and they were realized in the most dishonorable fashion. As autumn
    came, the disguise of security fell; as easy it was to rip the envelope that we 
    pretend guaranteed some unfounded binding agreement. Now bare and open, I guess
    nothing will ever be the same. But I am glad when it could be, it was, despite being only
    fluttering moments, they made them more potent. No longer as a peripheral sensation, but 
    they were (they had to be!) a concerted effort to embrace every single second, knowing
    that the end might just be around the corner.

   Christmas in Mexico, that was the plan. Though it slowly devolved with you 
   smoking with your boys, as I was consumed by work. Maybe all along I was all on my own,
   though your company made it all bearable. Is there no way to confront the reality that 
   a huge part of you was gone when the car crashed. But I could never bring myself to 
   face that, nor did you. How did we just relegate our lives to the whims of chance?
   And as the ugly head reared, we were helpless to see ourselves through it.
</p>

<p>
    But look ahead, champ! The beauty and the flaws, the choices and the mistakes, and all
    that complement your life, make this whole and complete. And as I assiduosly pour
    through what could be, your life does not rest on my divinity. Your life is yours, and 
    your choices to put the pieces together, and put up a fight as you never shied away. 
    The envelope was perhaps a superfluous cover all along, and that should have always 
    been the case. And maybe the weekends would be the same, for the both of us, with
    different company, but the legacy lives on.
