   How should you behave? Within the crowd that towered over you, with speeches and 
   ceremonial rituals that honestly I could not have cared less. And the worst of all,
   the lack of internet to ameliorate a little of the boredom with the screeen that
   I hold in my hand, pretending that no one is around. With the girl beside me who 
   refused to speak to me, with just a smirk to my banal remark of the ceremony; that 
   sealed the cake for me, and what was new here?
</p>

<p>
    Just the general vibe of everything, it was supposed to be a time of celebration. 
    Though a huge part of me was wondering if I should have been just more selfish, and 
    a little more demanding, to have my brother left alone, dealing with his recovery
    after his operation and have mum attend my graduation. Not that it matters, but
    graduation, veiled in robes, was a painfully vulnerable time. The moment felt like
    the undressing of the king, not that he was dressed at the start, but the realization
    that he was naked all this time was insripted in the diploma that bears my name.
</p>

<p>
   If it matters, and I do not think it does to me, the pure joy and relief that I 
   have completed something was accompanied by the subtle understanding that this 
   was an item of purchase. A receipt, if you would put it bluntly. Not of an accomplishment,
   but as a talisman that bears a certain value that I myself do not believe exists. At 
   least in the context of my completion of this journey. It has been great, I 
   learned a lot, and I have definitely grown as a human being throughout all that.
   But I should never forget that it is a receipt of purchase. One that cost my parents
   dearly, and for that I am forever indebted.
