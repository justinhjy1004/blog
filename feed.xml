    "You are the most useless gay friend ever!" sniggered Mariano as both of us stood 
    in the Railyard with beer in our hands. "Why don't you find a guy for me instead, be 
    useful for once." I retorted jokingly and he said "It does not work that way, haven't you 
    watched any tv shows before?"

    In the crowd of red, I couldn't really tell what was happening at all. Surrounded by
    the boisterous cheers because of an apparent touchdown and grunts from our opponents,
    Zayne told me that we were doing good and I trusted him. After all, I don't believe
    that I have even held a pigskin, if that is what it is called. All I could think then
    was that I paid $7 for less than a can of beer, and I am leaving behind work that I 
    know I would regret. But hey, it was game day and so, there we were.

    Squinting my eyes, I still could not see anything. It wasn't bad eyesight that 
    plagued me, there was a guy infront of me that seemed to have a penchant to 
    block my view. Irritated, I turned to Mariano and told him that. He laughed and I 
    did too. There was nothing new to be the shortest guy around, I have gotten used to it.
    "Look at that girl with a cap behind you" Mariano signaled, nudging me subtly to her but 
    I turned around immediately which he responded kindly by hitting me on my shoulder.

It is not difficult to feel out of place being a 5'6'' gay Malaysian in a tailgate party.
The tinge of envy I felt for the blonde was palpable, which bothered me further. 
Why did I care the attention that she had, of which she didn't even know exists? It was 
a confusing time, though it should not have been. But within the moments I started to
understand what it felt like to be a supporting character. Maybe the world is too small
for all of us to be the main character, or even our main character. 
</p>

<p>
    There is a bitterness with that thought, but after all, I was just another guy in red 
    within a sea of red, what is less 'supporting' than that? I couldn't just leave behind 
    the fact that I was one of the same, but different at the same time. But does it even 
    matter? Perhaps all I have to start doing is being accustomed to the life of a supporting
    character. And it is okay.
